# LLM_learning


Studying the Maxime Labonne LLM Learning course: https://github.com/mlabonne/llm-course

Completed: 1. The LLM architecture
* Learned a great deal about the LLM from Andrej Karpathy's GPT2 breakdown showing the decoding/encoding strategies, as well as self-attention broken down into understandable chunks to make optimizing LLM's easier and with more insightful knowledge. 
    code located: andrej_karpathy_gpt2_ex\gpt2_from_scratch.ipynb
* Understanding different decoding strategies was essential in Maxime Labonne's breakdown, showing greedy search, topk, nucleus search, etc. and the pro's and con's of each.
